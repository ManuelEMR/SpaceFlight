![recording](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0ba1cd8b-2aa0-49e2-984d-37f3127ce412)

# Description

Example app created using basic MVVM architecture, compose and koin.
Koin was used for simplicity instead of Dagger/Hilt.

# Unit tests

Unit test in file `SpaceFlightListViewModelTest.kt`

# Improvements

- We could fetch article detail from the API, and build a better ArticleDetailView. This would also enable us to showcase compose navigation.
- use `Article.url` and navigate to a browser.
